## Stretch Features

While JNMaps is already a powerful and intuitive application, our development timeline was limited to five days. As a result, there are several additional features that we would like to implement in the future:

- **User authentication**: Introduce login and logout functionality, allowing users to securely manage their profiles
- **Map sharing**: Enable users to share maps with friends or the wider community
- **Popular places**: Highlight the most visited or popular places within a given map
- **Rich information display**: Show ratings and other relevant details when a marker is clicked on a map

With these stretch features in place, JNMaps will become an even more impressive and comprehensive solution for users seeking a personalized mapping experience.
