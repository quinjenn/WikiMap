### JNMaps

JNMaps is an interactive web application that allows users to create, view, and modify maps with points of interest. Users can browse available maps, add new points, edit existing points, and favorite maps to personalize their experience. This application is perfect for travelers, explorers, and anyone looking to discover new places.

## Stretch Features

This project was a collaborative midterm done for the Full-Time Web Development bootcamp in Lighthouse Labs. We were required to make the project in the span of just five days, and because of that, we weren't able to implement as much functionality as we would have liked. Here are some stretch features that could still be added to the map:

- The app currently does not have login/logout functionality (the demo assumes users are already logged in)
- Be able to share maps with other users
- See what are the most visited/popular places in a given map
- See the ratings and other information of a place when I press on a marker
